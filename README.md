# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
   Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Key features:
Readability: Clear and easy-to-read syntax.
Versatility: Supports multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
Extensive Libraries: A vast standard library and numerous third-party modules.
Community Support: A large and active community.
Portability: Works on various platforms without modification.
Ease of Learning: Ideal for beginners.
Examples of use cases:

Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries like pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow.
Automation and Scripting: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Software Development: Creating desktop and business applications.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
  Download Python Installer:

Visit the official Python website.
Download the latest version for Windows.
Run the Installer:

Open the downloaded installer.
Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."
Choose "Install Now" or customize the installation as needed.
Verify the Installation:

Open Command Prompt.
Type python --version and pip --version to check Python and pip versions.
Set up a Virtual Environment:

Open Command Prompt.
Navigate to your project directory.
Run python -m venv myenv to create a virtual environment.
Activate the environment using myenv\Scripts\activate. 

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   Simple Python program:
print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:
print is a built-in function that outputs the specified message to the console.
"Hello, World!" is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   Integers (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 42
Floating-point numbers (float): Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14
Strings (str): Text, e.g., "Hello"
Booleans (bool): True or False
Lists (list): Ordered, mutable collections, e.g., [1, 2, 3]
Dictionaries (dict): Unordered collections of key-value pairs, e.g., {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
Example script:
# Integer
a = 10
print(a)

# Float
b = 3.14
print(b)

# String
c = "Python"
print(c)

# Boolean
d = True
print(d)

# List
e = [1, 2, 3]
print(e)

# Dictionary
f = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
print(f)

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   Conditional statements:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
Loops:


# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
Benefits: Code reuse, modularity, and easier debugging.
Example function:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
 Differences:

Lists: Ordered, can contain duplicates, indexed by position.
Dictionaries: Unordered, contain unique keys, indexed by keys.
Example script:

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)

# Dictionary
person = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}
print(person)
person['age'] = 31
print(person)  

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   Exception Handling allows you to handle errors gracefully and maintain the flow of the program.
Example:

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
finally:
    print("This will always execute")

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
  Modules: Single files containing Python code.
Packages: Directories containing multiple modules.
Example using the math module:

import math

# Using a function from the math module
print(math.sqrt(16)) 

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
   Reading:

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing:

lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Python's basics, installation, syntax, data types, control structures, functions, collections, exception handling, modules, and file I/O, offering clear examples and explanations for each topic.

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
